# RAIC Overlay Runtime Settings
# ==============================
#
# Place this file next to the executable as "settings.toml" to override build-time defaults.
# All settings are optional - omit any to use the default value from the build.
#
# Location: Same directory as the executable
#   Windows: C:\Program Files\RAIC Overlay\settings.toml
#   Development: target\debug\settings.toml or target\release\settings.toml

# Target Window Name
# ------------------
# The overlay will attach to windows containing this string in their title (case-insensitive).
# This determines which application the overlay tracks and syncs position with.
#
# Examples:
#   target_window_name = "Star Citizen"     # Production use
#   target_window_name = "Notepad"          # Testing with Notepad
#   target_window_name = "Chrome"           # Testing with Chrome
#
# Default: (from build-time .env file, typically "Star Citizen")
#
# target_window_name = "Star Citizen"

# Debug Border
# ------------
# Enable a red debug border around the overlay window boundaries.
# Useful for development to visualize the overlay area.
#
# Values: true or false
# Default: false
#
# debug_border = false

# Log Level
# ---------
# Controls the verbosity of log output.
# Higher verbosity levels include all lower levels.
#
# Values:
#   TRACE  - Most verbose, includes all internal details
#   DEBUG  - Development debugging information
#   INFO   - General operational information
#   WARN   - Warnings and errors only (default)
#   ERROR  - Only critical errors
#
# Note: DEBUG and INFO levels also enable console output for development.
#       WARN and ERROR only log to the log file.
#
# Default: WARN
#
# log_level = "WARN"
