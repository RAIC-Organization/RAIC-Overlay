# Implementation Plan: Settings Version Display

**Branch**: `047-settings-version-display` | **Date**: 2026-01-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/047-settings-version-display/spec.md`

## Summary

Display the bundled application version in the settings panel footer using small, muted text following standard desktop application conventions. The version will be retrieved at runtime using Tauri's `@tauri-apps/api/app` module which provides the `getVersion()` function that reads from `tauri.conf.json`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7.2 (React 19.0.0 frontend), Rust 2021 Edition (Tauri backend - unchanged)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19.0.0, Next.js 16.x, @tauri-apps/api 2.0.0, Tailwind CSS 4.x
**Storage**: N/A (version is read from build configuration at runtime)
**Testing**: vitest, @testing-library/react
**Target Platform**: Windows 11 (64-bit)
**Project Type**: Tauri desktop application with Next.js frontend
**Performance Goals**: Version display renders within 100ms of panel load
**Constraints**: Must match existing SC HUD theme styling
**Scale/Scope**: Single component modification (SettingsPanel.tsx)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Code Quality | ✅ PASS | Simple, single-responsibility addition to existing component |
| II. Testing Standards | ✅ PASS | Manual verification (T008-T010) sufficient for minimal scope (~15 LOC, single UI element, no complex logic). Automated test deferred per YAGNI. |
| III. User Experience Consistency | ✅ PASS | Uses existing muted-foreground color and font-display classes |
| IV. Performance Requirements | ✅ PASS | Single async call on mount, cached in state |
| V. Research-First Development | ✅ PASS | Tauri API researched via Context7 and official docs |

**Gate Result**: PASS - All principles satisfied. No violations requiring justification.

**Structure Decision**: This is a minimal UI enhancement affecting only the existing SettingsPanel component. No new files or structural changes required.

## Complexity Tracking
