## About

RAIC Overlay is a customizable overlay for Star Citizen that stays on top of your game. It provides helpful tools like notes, drawing, and timers without interrupting your gameplay.

The overlay supports two modes: a transparent click-through mode that doesn't interfere with your game, and an interactive mode for when you need to use the tools.
